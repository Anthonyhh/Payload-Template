# Satoshi Font Setup

To complete the Robolabs-inspired design, you need to download the Satoshi font files.

## Download Instructions:

1. Visit: https://www.fontshare.com/fonts/satoshi
2. Download the font family
3. Extract the WOFF2 files
4. Place these files in this directory:
   - `Satoshi-Regular.woff2`
   - `Satoshi-Medium.woff2`
   - `Satoshi-Bold.woff2`
   - `Satoshi-Black.woff2`

## Fallback Behavior:

Until the fonts are added, the site will fallback to Inter font gracefully.

## License:

Satoshi is free for personal and commercial use via Fontshare.
